 * text, a String
 * likes, an int
 * replies an int
 * author, a User

 * 
 * isCommentByAuthor should return true when the given author (in the argument)
 * is the same as the author of this VideoComment, false otherwise.
 * totalLikes should return the number of likes on this VideoComment object
 * unrollCommentThread should return a string in the following format:
 * 
 * <author username>
 * <l> likes; <r> replies
 * <text>
 * 
 * where <author> is replaced by the authorâ€™s name, <l> is replaced by the
 * number of likes on the VideoComment, <r> is replaced by the number of replies
 * on the VideoComment and <text> is replaced by the text of the Comment. The
 * string should end in a new line ("\n" character).
 * 
 * It should also add a new method public int totalInteractions();. This method
 * takes in no arguments, and return the sum of total number of replies and
 * likes for the given Comment.
